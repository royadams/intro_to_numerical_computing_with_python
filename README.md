# Materials for Introduction to Numerical Computing with Python

This repository contains the course materials for Introduction to Numerical Computing with Python originally offered in Fall 2016 at UMass. The repository is organized as follows:

## Syllabus

The course syllabus is contained in <code>cs590n_syllabus.docx</code> and <code>cs590n_syllabus.pdf</code>. These will obviously need to be adapted.

## Lecture slides

Latex source code for all slides is contained in <code>src</code> and pdfs of all slides are contained in <code>slides</code>. Sorry for any typos. Use <code>compile_all_slides.sh</code> to run pdflatex on all files src.

## Demos

This course was designed to be highly interactive. Students who were able were asked to download the demo before each lecture and bring their laptop to class. Students who could not do this were asked to pair with a student who could. In each set of lecture slides, there are one or more slides that say "demo". At these points, students were asked to work through the demo in the associated Jupyter notebook. Some of the "demo" slides also contain questions, and the students were asked to try to answer these questions as they worked through the Jupyter notebook. After a few minutes, we discussed discussed the demo and the answers to these questions. I found this process very effective at generating questions and discussion, but your mileage may vary. The <code>demos</code> directory contains all of these notebooks.

## Assignments
Latex, pdf, and python files for all assignments are in the <code>assignments</code> directory. I did not include the solutions files for obvious reasons.
